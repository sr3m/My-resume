<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm an Electromechanical, Mechanical Engineer 
(and an ongoing Master of Science in Pure Mathematics) with management, 
CAD/CAE/CAM design, hydraulics, thermodynamic systems, 
failure analysis and mathematical modeling experience.</p>

<p>I have been working for the Engineering and Commissioning
department of the LNG terminal expansion project at AES Andres.
In this role, I have had the opportunity to contribute
to the management and coordination of tests for all systems
and equipment of the new LNG terminal.
In addition, I have been involved in reporting on the
progress of the commissioning process, analyzing and implementing 
solutions related to the first LNG terminal start-up
(Purge and Dry-out, system cooldown and stabilization)
and the stable-state regasification process, monitoring of operations,
management and control of hazardous energy, and documentation control
[including the constructive deviations correction
management system (Oracle Unifier)].</p>

<p>I was a member of the teaching assistance staff at the
"Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo" in the
Mathematics School of the Faculty of Sciences,
where I spent more than 10 hours per week in
explaining the topics covered by math professors,
performing exercises, clarifying doubts, and correcting
assignments in various subjects. Also, I was a member of
the coordination team with the main role of assigning and scheduling
all the teaching assistance staff to all math subjects
schedule by the University for each semester.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am a freelance graphic designer with
extensive experience and a Python programmer.</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Pure Mathematical
Sciences at the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo,
focusing in mathematical abstractions, functional and real
analysis, measurement theory and statistics.</p>
